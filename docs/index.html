                            <b>eduViz</b> is a visualization project that aims to make sense of the recently-released <a href="https://collegescorecard.ed.gov/data/">College Scorecard Data</a>.
                            The dataset, provided by the Department of Education, contains information on higher-education institutions. Some of the metrics provided are admission rates, student completion rates,
                            debt and repayment, earnings, demographics and more. The dataset contains nearly twenty years of data, with about 1700 variables tracked. Most of this visualization will focus on data
                            from 2013.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Availability of variables and their associated values becomes sparse in earlier years of the dataset.

                            Cohort earnings data is from 2011 (most recent available).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This analysis is designed for data scientists, analysts, and others with statistical literacy.
                            Others looking to create data graphics, articles, or more focused analyses will find this project useful.
                            In particular, members of the <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/kaggle/college-scorecard/scripts">Kaggle</a> community
                            can benefit from it.
                            An effort is made to ensure that the analysis is replicable and transparent for others.
                            While analysis is thorough and focuses on many variables, it is by no means exhaustive.

                        <h3>Process - Data manipulation</h3>
                        <p>
                            Due to the immensity and complexity of the dataset, a meticulous approach to data manipulation is required. In the interest of providing full transparency to the process,
                            I have documented every step taken to parse the dataset. This is also done to ensure that other data scientists and developers can reproduce the parsed data and get the same result.
                            The key tools used are <i><a href="https://www.python.org/">Python</a></i>,
                            <i><a href="http://www.grymoire.com/Unix/Sed.html">sed,</a></i> and <i><a href="https://csvkit.readthedocs.org/en/0.9.1/">csvkit</a></i>.

                            Before diving into the data, it is useful to understand certain terms as they relate to higher education.
                            It is particularly important to understand terms related to lending practices. Recently, many institutions' lending practices have been called into question,
                            and much controversy arises on the subjects of tuition, loans and grants.

EduViz focuses moreso on grants, a type
                                            of financial aid that doesn't need to be repaid. Title IV aid varies in the conditions necessary to receive it - often it is provided on the basis of a student's financial need,
                                            or outstanding academic achievements. For the purpose of this project, analysis will focus on the most relevant form of Title IV aid, the Pell Grant.

                                            Our dataset provides the percentage of students receiving Pell grants for each given university. This can be used as an indicator of how well an institution serves
                                            low-income students. Institutions with a high percentage of students receiving Pell grants will better accomodate poorer students.

                                            Pell grants are administered by the US Department of Education, who assess information reported on a student's FAFSA (Free Application for Federal Student Aid.)
                                            Metrics such as expected family income are used to determine a student's eligibility. Pell grants are generally considered the foundation of a student's
                                            financial aid package. These visualizations may use the variable <strong>PctPell</strong> to describe the percent of students receiving Pell grants at an institution.

                                            One of the focuses of this visualization project is to understand differences between public and private universities.
                                            The key difference is that public universities are funded by state governments, whereas private universities don't receive any state funding.
                                            Public universities generally offer lower tuition rates because they are subsidized, while private universities rely on higher tuition rates and
                                            generous private contributions to cover operating costs.

                                            Private schools exist as either <i>non</i>profit or <i>for-</i>profit institutions. For-profit schools are operated privately by profit-seeking businesses.
                                            While for-profit schools are thought to fulfill an economic need of education, they are frequently criticized for their lending practices, tuition costs, and
                                            dismal student outcomes. In the dataset, the type of institution may be referred to as <strong>Control</strong>.

                                            An accredited school is one recognized as meeting standards of education, admission, and student outcomes.
                                            The aim is to ensure that schools maintain a quality level of education. Accrediting agencies exist to determine how well
                                            certain schools are meeting their standards; these external orgnizations will determine whether or not a school is given

                                            Evaluating if an education is worthwhile can be modeled using cost and earnings data.
                                            Each school is given an <i>earnings-to-cost</i> ratio, calculated by dividing median annual earnings
                                            by annual cost.

                                            In plotting this metric, an interesting trend occurs for public schools.
                                            The histogram shows that almost every public school has an earnings-to-cost ratio
                                            greater than one.

                                            It is interesting to note that for public schools, along with quite a number of private for-profit schools,
                                            those schools with greater proportion of black students tend to have lower completion rates.
                                            It is difficult to interpret this observation, but one can speculate.

                                            There is a demonstrable correlation between socioeconomic status
                                            and academic ability. A recent <a href="http://nyti.ms/1Ulvfms">New York Times article</a>
                                            shows the degree to which income and affluence affect academic achievement.

                                            The College Scorecard analysis affirms the notion that students from poorer families
                                            will experience greater challenges academically, and that academic gaps persist into post-secondary education.

                                    Amidst stagnant economic growth and a precarious job market, many question whether or not a college-level education
                                    is worth having. The dataset provides some useful metrics in evaluating outcomes from these institutions.
                                    Earnings data exists is provided in numerous forms. Important to note is that
                                    these figures are taken from 2011, the most recent years in which earnings were reported.
                                    Because these are 10 year cohort groups, the numbers correspond to the group of students who enrolled from 2001-2002.

                                    In order to decide whether or not a given institution provides students with favorable outcomes, one must compare the cost
                                    of education with the outcome. Analysis will use cost and earnings metrics to determine this.

                                                <strong>Median cost of attendance - </strong> This is a more reliable metric than using tuition;
                                                the College Scorecard includes this variable, which gives average annual cost of attendance, accounting for tuition, fees,

                                                For instance, one might examine the share of students who make greater than $25,000 a year. The threshold of $25,000 was chosen
                                                by College Scorecard because it represents the median wage of workers ages 25 to 34 with only a high-school education.

                                                <strong>Earnings-to-cost ratio - </strong> This metric is calculated by dividing median earnings by average cost of attendance.
                                                Other things equal, a higher earnings-to-cost ratio suggests that the school succeeds in providing marketable skills for its
                                                tuition. In theory, schools with an earnings-to-cost ratio lower than 1.0 suggest that the education
                                                does not yield sufficient returns to justify the cost.

                            Comparing cost and earnings is a good place to start. While there are some limitations with
                            the earnings data, the aggregate figures can give us a good insight as to overall market
                            trends.

                            The dataset gives us a generous array of variables with which to examine demographics.
                            With these variables, we can paint a broad picture of what higher-education student population
                            looks like at a number of institutions. The intricacy and granularity of our variables can
                            also allow us to drill down further and look for patterns of interest.

                                        certain institutions deliberately target independent students as part of a predatory lending
                                        intent. As our data are high-level aggregate figures, we likely cannot draw a conclusion
                                        with certainty from our dataset. However, there might be suggestive patterns present.

                        <h3>Race: Admission and Completion</h3>
                        <p>
                            Many of the most prestigious and costly universities also have high completion rates.
                            However, these schools are often very homogenous (Caucasian) and lack racial diversity.
                            One finding of this data exploration is that schools with greater diversity have lower completion rates.
                            It isn't feasible to draw a causal link with this information, but lower completion rates in more diverse
                            schools suggest that ethnic minorities may not have the same opportunities.

                                    In constructing a web-based visualization, it is often useful to have a style guide.
                                    Although creating a style guide can be time-intensive, it ultimately saves a great deal of time
                                    deliberating over small details such as fonts, colors, alignment and overall aesthetics.

                                    Color-blind accessibility and readability are critical for visualizations featuring color
                                    as a functional dimension.
                                    The use of style and aesthetics in
                                    visualizations is not only for visual appeal; it serves the function of making information
                                    more accessible and digestible to readers. My colors are derived from Tableau's
                                    <i>Color Blind 10</i> palette.
